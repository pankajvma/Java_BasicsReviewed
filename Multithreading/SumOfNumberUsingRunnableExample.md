Here we are calculating the sum of number from 0-5000. We are performimg multithreading here by executing both the thread together. Here half of the calculation is done by first thread and the remaining by other thread. Alsso we are verifying the output with the sum produced using the IntStream class.

The multithreading here is performed by using Runnamble interface.
